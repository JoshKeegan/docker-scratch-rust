# By default rustc will only compile with dynamic linking, adding an external runtime dependency on glibc.
#   MUSL supports static though (with some other caveats that don't matter for a simple hello-world app), 
#   so base off of an image with that installed & set up for us and we'll use that build target with the 
#   static flag for a really slim from scratch image.
